    <h2>Statistics Empowering Data Science (SEEDS)</h2>
    <p>
      The SEEDS inaugural conference is a two-day event organized by the <a href="https://usc-dso-stat-group.github.io/">Statistics Group</a> within the Data Sciences and Operations (DSO) Department of the University of Southern California, Marshall School of Business.

    </p>
    <p>

      The aim of this conference is to educate participants on the interconnections between statistics, data science, and business research problems, with the intention of stimulating fresh collaborations, uncovering novel research directions, and helping keep our higher education offerings up to date. 

    </p>
    <p>


This conference is based on two premises: (1) many recent developments in statistics are not fully understood beyond the discipline; (2) numerous academic researchers in statistics tend to focus on relatively abstract problems and lack awareness of the latest data science challenges faced by relevant industries. As part of a top-ranked business school, we strive to tackle the most challenging real-world problems, conduct highly relevant research of the utmost quality, and educate the next generation of statistics leaders. At the same time, we aim to serve as a role model for the broader statistics community. This conference plays a key role in our efforts and aligns perfectly with the ongoing expansion of the Marshall Business School in the areas of Data Science and Machine Learning.

    </p>
    <p>

In addition to invited talks from distinguished statistics researchers working in academia and/or industry, this conference will feature: 

<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
  <li>A datathon competition for students, with cash awards, focusing on the application of cutting edge statistical methodology to real-world business problems.</li>
  <li>A poster session and networking opportunity for PhD students./li>
  <li>A best paper award for PhD students.</li>
</ul> 

The aforementioned events will be open to both USC and external students from other institutions.
